# Tic-Tac-Toe

This is a client application for an API that allow users to sign up, log in, and play tic tac toe games.

Tic tac toe is a pencil and paper game in which two players play X's or O's in a grid on alternating turns, and the first player to create a complete line of their symbol wins.

### Technologies Used

Javascript, HTML, CSS/Sass
JQuery, AJAX
Bootstrap, Webpack
Bash, curl

### Plan

My plan was to first build the structure of the HTML page, to get a visual display of a board. Next I would build the game logic, to have a working tic tac toe game that allowed x's and o's to be placed. Basic authentication functions to the API's specifications were next, so that I could continue with using the API for game events as well. Once those were working, I would return to the UI to make things look prettier.
